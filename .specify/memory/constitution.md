# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clear and Beginner-Friendly Explanations
All content must be accessible to beginners with no prior robotics or AI knowledge; explanations should use simple language, analogies, and step-by-step guidance; complex concepts must be broken down into digestible parts with clear learning progressions.

### II. Accurate and Verified Technical Content
All technical claims must be verifiable through authoritative sources or practical implementation; content must be fact-checked and validated before publication; any theoretical concepts must be supported by real-world applications or proven research.

### III. Practical, Real-World Robotics Relevance
Content must connect directly to real-world robotics applications; examples and exercises should reflect actual robotics challenges and solutions; focus on skills and knowledge that have practical utility in robotics development.

### IV. Consistent Structure Across All Chapters
Each chapter must follow the standardized structure: Introduction → Core Concepts → Practical Example → Summary; consistent formatting, terminology, and pedagogical approach across all chapters; maintain uniform learning experience throughout the textbook.

### V. AI-Native Learning Design
Content must leverage AI tools and methodologies for enhanced learning; incorporate interactive elements and AI-assisted learning features; design for AI-powered study aids and automated feedback systems.

## Content Standards
All technical claims must be verifiable; writing style must be simple, professional, and structured; no AI hallucinations allowed; each chapter must include: Introduction, Core Concepts, Practical Example, Summary; all content must be original with 0% plagiarism tolerance.

## Technical Constraints
Format: Markdown (.md); Platform: Docusaurus; Deployment: GitHub Pages; Toolchain: Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code; Target Audience: Beginners to intermediate learners; No copyrighted content allowed; Strict adherence to ethical AI practices.

## Success Criteria
Book builds successfully in Docusaurus; GitHub Pages deployment works correctly; Content is accurate, clear, and reproducible; The book serves as a complete self-learning resource; All chapters meet the defined structure and quality standards.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation and technical decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project; All contributions must comply with these principles; Amendments require documentation and approval through the project's standard review process; All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
