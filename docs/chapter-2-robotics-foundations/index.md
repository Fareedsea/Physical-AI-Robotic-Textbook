# Chapter 2: Robotics Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Describe the fundamental components of robotic systems
- Explain the history and evolution of robotics
- Identify different types of robots and their applications
- Understand basic robotic control systems
- Recognize the relationship between mechanical design and robotic function

## Introduction

Now that we understand the concept of Physical AI, let's explore the foundational principles of robotics itself. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. In this chapter, we'll cover the essential elements that form the basis of all robotic systems, from simple industrial arms to complex humanoid robots.

Robotics has evolved significantly since the term was first coined in 1942 by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. What began as a concept in imagination has become an essential part of modern manufacturing, exploration, medicine, and even our daily lives. Understanding these foundations is crucial for grasping how humanoid robots and Physical AI systems operate.

## Chapter Outline

This chapter will guide you through the fundamental aspects of robotics:

1. **Core Concepts**: We'll explore the basic components of robots, different types of robotic systems, and the history of robotics development.
2. **Practical Example**: We'll examine a real-world application that demonstrates foundational robotics principles.
3. **Summary**: We'll review the key concepts and connect them to the broader field of robotics.

Let's begin by understanding what makes up a robot and the fundamental components that enable robotic systems to function.
