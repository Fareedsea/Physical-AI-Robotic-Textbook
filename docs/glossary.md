# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary contains definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### Actuator
A component of a robot that converts energy (usually electrical) into physical motion. Actuators are responsible for the robot's ability to move and interact with its environment.

### AI-native Learning
An approach to education that leverages artificial intelligence tools and methodologies for enhanced learning, including interactive elements, AI-assisted learning features, and AI-powered study aids.

## B

### Behavioral Robotics
A branch of robotics focused on creating robots that exhibit lifelike behaviors through reactive control systems, often mimicking biological systems.

## C

### Control System
A system that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems. In robotics, control systems are essential for coordinating robot movements and responses.

## D

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The number of independent movements a mechanical system can make. In robotics, this refers to the number of joints or independent movements a robot possesses.

## E

### Embodiment
The physical form of an AI system. Physical AI emphasizes the importance of having a physical body for interaction with the real world.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The use of joint parameters to compute the Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector of a robot arm.

## G

### Gait
The pattern of movement of the limbs of legged robots or animals during locomotion.

## H

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with physical features resembling those of a human, typically having a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
Mathematical process used to determine the joint parameters needed to place the end-effector of a robot arm in a specific position and orientation.

## J

### Joint Space
The set of all possible joint configurations for a robot manipulator.

## K

### Kinematics
The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.

## L

### Locomotion
The ability to move from one place to another. In robotics, this refers to the various methods by which robots achieve movement.

## M

### Motion Planning
The computational problem of finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves an object from an initial configuration to a goal configuration.

## N

### Navigation
The ability of a robot to move through an environment, typically involving localization, mapping, and path planning.

## P

### Physical AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through embodiment in robotic systems, emphasizing the importance of physical interaction for intelligence.

### Proprioception
The sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement, which robots can achieve through internal sensors.

## R

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for creating robot applications.

### ROS (Robot Operating System)
A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for creating robot applications.

## S

### Sensor Fusion
The process of combining data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy and reliability of information obtained from the environment.

### Servo Motor
A rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position, velocity, and acceleration.

## T

### Teleoperation
The remote operation of a robot by a human operator, often used for tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans to perform directly.

## V

### Visual Servoing
The process of using visual feedback to control the motion of a robot, typically using cameras to guide the robot's actions.
