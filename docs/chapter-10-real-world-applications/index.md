## Introduction

This final chapter brings together all the concepts explored throughout this textbook by examining how robotics is applied in real-world contexts. From manufacturing and healthcare to service industries and exploration, robots are transforming how we live, work, and interact with our environment.

The applications of robotics span virtually every sector of human activity, demonstrating the versatility and potential of robotic systems. Each application area presents unique challenges and opportunities, requiring tailored approaches that integrate the fundamental concepts of robotics: sensing, actuation, control, perception, learning, and human interaction.

Real-world robotics applications must balance technical capabilities with practical constraints such as cost, safety, reliability, and user acceptance. Success in these applications depends on understanding both the technical requirements and the human factors that influence adoption and effectiveness.

This chapter explores various application domains, examining how the principles of Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and the other concepts covered throughout this textbook come together in practical implementations that address real-world challenges.
