# History Log: Task 28 - Final UI Polish & Responsive Testing

**Date**: 2025-12-07T23:08:40+05:00
**Type**: Task Execution

## Prompt
"continue task" (Proceed with Task 28)

## Work Performed
1. Re-read specifications.
2. Verified `frontend/src/css/custom.css` and added:
   - Mobile media queries for Hero text resizing.
   - Custom scrollbar styling to match the "Physical AI" neon theme.
3. Updated `frontend/src/components/Chatbot/styles.module.css`:
   - Fixed mobile positioning of the chat window to ensure it doesn't overlap weirdly or get cut off.
4. Updated `tasks.md`.

## Outcome
The application UI is polished, with corrected mobile layouts and a consistent "Cyber/Robotic" aesthetic down to the scrollbars.
