# GitHub Commit: Initialize Project

**Type**: General Request

## Commit Title
chore: initialize project structure and read specs

## Summary
Initialized the project by creating `tasks.md` and verifying specifications in `Info.md` and `instructions.md`.

## Files Modified
- `tasks.md` (Created)

## Why Change Was Needed
`Info.md` requires `tasks.md` to be the single source of truth for execution. This step initializes that file.

## Git Commit Command
```bash
git add tasks.md
git commit -m "chore: initialize project structure and read specs"
```

## Git Commit Description
```text
Initialize project structure and read specs

- Create tasks.md based on Info.md requirements
- Verify instructions.md and Info.md
```
